                    Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D Printing, embraces a wide range of materials and derivative processes to build parts suitable for end-use service. The virtually unlimited design freedom enabled by additive manufacturing allows for the creation of shapes and the integration of feature and function that previously required sub-assemblies. Employment opportunities for design engineers are growing as the industry adopts additive manufacturing methods and applies the practice to various parts of their business from prototyping to end use parts.
